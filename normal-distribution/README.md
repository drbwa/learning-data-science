# Normal Distributions

Some basic operations on normally distributed data using Python for now  and
maybe R later on.

For example:
* Plot histograms and density curves. 
* Test for normally distributed data using visual approaches as well as more
  formal tests. 
* Calculate the proportion of data below, above or between two points.
